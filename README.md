Peer-Assessment
===============

This repository contains the working files for the "Peer Assessment" assignment for the course Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" (Week 2).



This file gives an overview of the repository and explains how the R scripts work.


**Overview of the repository**

This repository contains:

* Readme.md - This file explaining what is in the repository.
* CodeBook.md - Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
* run_analysis.R - R scrip that generates the "tidy_data" files.
* tidy_data.csv - The "tidy data" file generated by running the "run analysis.R" script file. CSV format.
* tidy_data_dput_dataset.R  - The "tidy data" file generated by running the "run analysis.R" script file. dput format.
* Peer Assessment.Rproj - R project file.
* .RProj.user - R project folder.

**How the R scripts work**

There is only 1 R script called "run_analysis.R". This script does the following:

* Loads a "features" file to a data.frame
* Loads a "activity" label file to a data.frame
* Loads a "test results" file to a data.frame
* Loads a "train results" file to a data.frame
* Merges the test and train results data frames
* Adds activity and column heading labels
* Filters the dataset to only those features or measurements that have standard deviations pre-processed
* Aggregates those results against unique combinations of subject and activity.
* Saves the results to files in CSV and DPUT file formats.

It is based on the underlying source files being stored in the following sub-folders:

* UCI_HAR_Dataset - contains some metadata files about the tests held, including a README.txt that explains the data as originally sourced from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* UCI_HAR_Dataset\train - contains the train results
* UCI_HAR_Dataset\test - contains the test results
